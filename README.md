Sicredi Dragons

An application used to CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE, (CRUD) dragons with an unique Login, built with React, JavaScript, and CSS. Designed mobile first.

Project Status

This project is currently in development. Users can use all the functionalityes need. Need to add more error pages and increment more tests (aiming to achieve 70% coverage). Add an extra page with the dragons histories.

Project Extras: 

I added a extra feature that is to add a dragon, also added an error404 page, you can get there by typing something that doen't exists in the url, one more feature that I put in this project is the flip card, so instead of a pege with the dragons info you just hover your mouse on the cards and they flip whith all the info you need about them.

Reflection

This project had me out of my confort zone while experimenting with some things that I'm not used to use such as contexts and design mobile first, those two things made my life so much easier while making me learn a lot more about react and css 

I had an dependency error while coding unfortunally React18 has a bug if working whith an older version of react router dom, I'm used to use version 5.3v of RRD therefore I had to downgrade my React to version 17.0.2v.

I started the project using npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript, to minimize initial setup time investment. Typescript helps to keep the code easier to debug while helping with logic errors along the way, It also supports you in case you forget about a prop that is necessary fro some implementation to work.

Some of the technologies that I implemented in this project are React, React-Router-dom 5.3.0v, JSX, Styled-components, Jest, toastify, typescript.
